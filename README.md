# Clinical Trial Finder DS Repo

Before we get started, lets outline some of the goals for the Data Science Team:
* Analyze data for actionable insights to pass on to our customers.
* Test the feasability of a predictive model that will be able to predict, with statistical significance, the probability of a trial reaching the completion stage.
* A search engine that returns relevant clinical trials based upon a customer query.
